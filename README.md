# Kaggle Datasets 2021
My attempt on kaggle tabular playground competition

* Tabular July 2021: Using keras model and it did okay. Then, I tried using Regression with pycaret and it performs better.
* Tabular June 2021: Using keras model at it performing decent. Was a little bit stuck when I only got around 30%-ish accuracy. And turns out everyone also got 30%ish accuracy.

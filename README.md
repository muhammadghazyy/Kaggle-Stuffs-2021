#My attempt on kaggle competitions and stuffs

* Tabular July 2021: Using keras model and it did okay. Then, I tried using Regression with pycaret and it performs better.
* Tabular June 2021: Using keras model at it performing decent. Was a little bit stuck when I only got around 30%-ish accuracy. And turns out everyone also got 30%ish accuracy.
* Disaster tweets : My first ever attempt in handling text data and It did not really bad with 77% on kaggle
* Tabular Aug 2021 : Tried to use tensorflow but it seems not going well so instead using pycaret's ridge regression. Final RMSE score was 7.9ish (First place was 7.8)
